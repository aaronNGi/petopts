 petopts
========================================================================

Portable and simple option parsing, powered by getopts(1p).

Unlike most (bash) option parser frameworks, where the complexity can
easily dwarf that of the actual script, petopts is purposefully made as
simple and concice as possible.


 Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Very minimal
* Simple to use
* Portable
* POSIX utility conventions compliance
* No GNU style long options
* No optional parameters
* Count of option occurrences
* Short usage message
* Support "\-\-" argument to indicates the end of the options


 Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the content of [petopts.sh](petopts.sh) to the top of your script
and change the 3 variables at the top. The variables are:

`options`: A string containing the space separated list of alphanumeric
option characters. If a character is followed by a \<colon>, the option
shall be expected to have an argument.

`usage`: The string printed by the `usage()` function.

`version`: The string printed by the `version()` function.

For each option in the `options` variable, petopts will set
corresponding variables in the form of `opt_*` and `arg_*`, where `*` is
the option character. The `opt_*` variables will hold the number of
occurences of the options (unset if an option does not occur), while the
`arg_*` variables store the option arguments (empty if an option has no
option argument).

After parsing the options, the positional parameters are shifted until
only operands remain.

For example, to conditionally do something with the option 'a', we could
do:

```sh
[ "$opt_h" ] && usage
[ "$opt_v" ] && version
[ "$opt_a" ] &&
	printf 'Option a present with argument: %s\n' "$arg_a"
```

petopts comes with the following functions:

`die()`: Prints its arguments to stderr and exits the script with status
1.

`usage()`: Prints the content of the `usage` variable and exits the
script with status 0.

`version()`: Prints the content of the `version` variable and exits the
script with status 0.

For a complete script using petopts, check [example.sh](example.sh).


 Usage of eval
------------------------------------------------------------------------

`eval` is considered dangerous because it can execute "dirty" data and
thus allow arbitrary code execution. However, how petopts uses `eval`,
to dynamically set the option variables, is totally safe.


 Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* No GNU style long options
* No optional parameters
